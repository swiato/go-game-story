📖 Story Overview
The story follows a young boy in a fictional country in Central Europe. Lost in fantasy worlds of RPGs, anime, and video games, he struggles with social anxiety and low self-esteem—with only one close friend for support.

At the start of a new school year, he hesitantly steps in to stop a bullying incident. Though socially awkward, his actions draw the attention of a mysterious new Japanese teacher, who introduces him to Atari Go (a simplified version of Go).

This unexpected encounter ignites a spark. Soon, he learns that a national Go prodigy is attending the same school. After a heated exchange, they make a bet:
➡️ Meet in the finals of the national Go championship.

Thus begins a journey of self-growth, rivalry, and discovery—told through the lens of learning and mastering the ancient game of Go.
